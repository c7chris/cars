# The Cars App

This application provides an API to access a repository of cars.

# Problem statement

## The Story

"As a consumer of a RESTFul API, I would like to be able to add, retrieve, and remove *cars*."

### The Acceptance Criteria

* Priority order is:
    1. add
    2. retrieve 
    3. remove
* A *car* has the following attributes:
    * id*
    * make
    * model
    * colour
    * year
* We do not require persistent storage at this stage (an in-memory store is fine).

*generated by the application on entry

## Subsequent stories

These are stretch goals if you have time (you can do them in any order):

* "As a Developer, I want my code to be covered by tests, so I know if a change has broken something"
* "As a Consumer of the API, when reading the car model information I would like to see an additional field containing a string of a few words that sound like the model of the cars I have added" (using [http://www.datamuse.com/api/](http://www.datamuse.com/api/) as the source).
* "As a Consumer of the API, I would like to be able to update my existing cars"
* "As a Consumer of the API, I would like any cars I add through the API to persist between application restarts (persistent storage)"
* "As a Consumer of the API, I would like cars to be represented as two separate, hierarchically linked resources: 
    1. *Make*
    1. *Model*

## Limitations

You can use whatever online resources you want (aside from copy-pasting large chunks of code).

You are encouraged to use any frameworks or libraries you feel comfortable with.

You will be asked about the code you submit so you should be able to explain why every line is there.

# Solution

## Getting Started

This is a Maven-based Spring Boot application using the Web and Data components, with an H2 database.

### Prerequisites

Java 8 JDK along with an IDE like IntelliJ Idea or Eclipse.

### Installing

1) Clone the repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/c7chris/cars.git
```

2) Run the application

```
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

3) Access the API

Please refer to the Swagger documentation for details of the endpoints available: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

## Sample requests

1) POST - create request

```
http://localhost:8080/car
{
	"make": "Nissan",
	"model": "Altima",
	"colour": "White",
	"year": 1992
}
```

2) GET - retrieve request

```
http://localhost:8080/car/1
```

3) PUT - update request

```
http://localhost:8080/car
{
	"id": 1,
	"make": "Toyota",
	"model": "Land Cruiser",
	"colour": "White",
	"year": 2015
}
```

4) DELETE - remove request

```
http://localhost:8080/car/1
```

## Running the tests

```
$ mvn test
```

### H2 Database console

Can be accessed at: [http://localhost:8080/h2-console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console). Click on the 'Connect' button to open the database.

The gives a UI view of the database and allows queries to be run to check the database contents, such as:

```
SELECT * FROM CAR
```

## Built With

* [SpringBoot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) - The framework used
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* [H2 Database](https://www.h2database.com) - The database
* [Datamuse](http://www.datamuse.com/api/) - The API used to find words that sound similar
